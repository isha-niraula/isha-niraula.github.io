Welcome to the man’s world.When I say ‘man’, i mean it.Some of you might be thinking that this girl sounds like any other feminist who has a bunch of complains with men.But I am sure at the end of the article,I will be able to explain to you about my prospective of feminism.

I don’t  come from a world where women are still expected to be confined within the house and household activities.Today women are free to choose their lives,their priorities.But there had also been a time when women could do nothing but surrender themselves to their husbands and gods.But I will not say that the world I come from is equally women’s as men’s.It is not a world of equality.At present,there are roughly three different scenarios regarding the position of women in the Nepal.The first one:the women in villages who are worshipped as goddesses but on the other hand equally abused in the name of practising witchcraft.These women are usually married at early age and are responsible for making babies and taking care of house.The second one:the women in the urban areas,those who are free to choose their lives .They are among the working women with reputable jobs and positions.They are often regarded as the role models for women in the society.The third one:women who come from mediocre background.They are one who juggle between household work and offices.They are self sustained but also grounded to impratical customs.They are capable of earning their life but are made to believe that supreme power of the family are men.

Feminism is an ideology that is established to achieve the political,economic,personal as well as social rights of women.The idea was brought to create equality between men and women nomatter what background the women belonged to.The old idea of feminism was centrally focused on ensuring the rights of women and making them as powerful as any other male in the society.However, the modern concept of feminism has often been a misinterpreted one.The idea of modern feminism often regards males as chauvinists,creates a sense of helplessness in females and considers them a victim and males as the culprits.It ensures rights of women and respect only through a forcefully fed process and not through a natural understanding.The modern and the misinterpreted concept of feminism emphasises on rights of female but not on the idea that women are equally responsible for fulfilling their duties.I believe this concept questions the ability and talent of women and is centrally focussed on the wrong things men do.

All human beings are born equal.Feminism should not make you forget that there are some assets of being a women that cannot be sidelined in the name of feminism.A women before being a women is equally a human as men are.I am not talking on the behalf of the male chauvinists but on behalf of all the people who are suffering in the name feminism which is a misinterpreted idea now.

I agree with the fact that it has been man’s  world and may be it will always remain one.I don’t know if there had ever been a women’s world like in the world of honey bees where queen rules.I am a woman myself but I don’t want to be called a feminist.I want women to be empowered.I want women to be free.But I don’t believe in bringing forceful changes.I believe women must themselves be responsible for creating the respect they want.They should themselves earn the world they want to create.This modern concept of feminism is not a tool to equality instead a biased idea that is somehow disturbing the harmony between men and women.Thus to create equality, we must join our hands together as humans not as ‘men’ or ‘women’.
