I am not an absolute foodie.But I will also not deny that I love food and get crazy cravings out of blue for the food I love.Sometimes,I wake up in the middle of the night and start munching my favourite noodles because I cannot resist hunger at all.I get annoyed when I am hungry and the only solution is food.Food mends my rended soul.To me,it is not just a source of energy it is my source of life.

Everyone loves food.Who does not?All of us have a  favourite dish.Some of us enjoy simple food made by our mom whereas some love exploring different cuisines outside home.Most of us enjoy junk food at different restaurants and cannot imagine our lives without street food.I am sure most of us have already started to imagine ourselves eating even right now.But are we mindful enough to be thankful for the food we eat everyday?

Have we ever thought that millions of animals are slaughtered everyday to feed us?Everyday millions of plants are cut down for food.The plate full of food that we eat is actually the sacrifice made by plants,animals and even human beings.Everytime we eat a spoonful of rice,are we mindful enough to think about it’s source,about the amount of effort put by people to get it into our plates?Even when we leave some food in our plates,do we ever think about people who have no money to eat and die of poverty?Everytime we overeat,do we ever think that while some people in this world suffer from obesity there are others who die of hunger?Everytime we criticise the taste of food, do we ever think about what food does to us?

Today I see many people are interested in exploring food.That is why restaurant culture is growing day by day.But the irony is:while some people get to explore food,some don’t even get a bit of it.What is the use of big restaurants and hotels if they cannot serve those hungry souls?We have enough,don’t we?Then why is it that the so called explorers of food only serve for us and not for those who truely need it?Well,this is something we cannot change!But I am sure we can change few things if we become mindful.

I am sure we can change things if we cultivate compassion in our hearts.I am sure some of these things will definitely change if we appreciate the food we eat,if we eat just enough and not overeat,if we think of those hungry souls before wasting food.I am sure things will change when we start serving food not just for quenching our thirsts but for mending our souls and for life.

Enjoy your food!:
