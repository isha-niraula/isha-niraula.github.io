I"Ç<p>Sometimes I wish I was born before technology took over,before telephone,television,internet and social networks to be particular.I wish I was born during the period when people had nothing to entertain themselves,when music was created with leaves and branches of tree,when even silence could be heard and when photographs were what peopleâ€™s eyes captured.I wish I was born in those days when I could spend my whole day staring at the clouds changing their shape and sky changing itâ€™s colour,in those days when people wrote letters with their hand and internet was not even in their furthest imagination.I know I sound very impractical.But have you ever thought about it? About life without machines and technology?Things would  be simpler and more real.People would write their hearts into paper,capture every moment in their hearts instead of a camera,speak their minds out,sing and dance like mads and live life like a movie!People would keep it real!</p>
