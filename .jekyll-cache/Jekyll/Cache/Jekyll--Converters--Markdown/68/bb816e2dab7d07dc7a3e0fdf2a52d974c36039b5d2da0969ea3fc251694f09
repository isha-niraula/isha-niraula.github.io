I"™<p>I am not an absolute foodie.But I will also not deny that I love food and get crazy cravings out of blue for the food I love.Sometimes,I wake up in the middle of the night and start munching my favourite noodles because I cannot resist hunger at all.I get annoyed when I am hungry and the only solution is food.Food mends my rended soul.To me,it is not just a source of energy it is my source of life.</p>
