I"<p>I started fumbling for words when I decided to write about ‘flag’.Just then,I discovered the poet in me( if we can call it a poem). The poem (I would rather refer to it as ‘lines’)   describes the ‘flag man’.If you are true folk of Kathmandu,you might have understood that I am talking about Laxmi Narayan Shilpakar(hope I got his name correct).He is always seen holding the national flag.Thanks to him,wherever we are:whether stuck in traffic,in rain or under the clear blue sky,he gives us the insight of who we are!</p>
