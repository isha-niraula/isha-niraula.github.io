I"š<p>His head held high 
Holds the flag upright 
While it flutters in the sky
In rain and when the sun shines bright
Ponders every lad,every passerby
He who holds it tight 
Gives an insight
Would it not be a piece of cloth,so light!
If not we hold it right!</p>

<p>I started fumbling for words when I decided to write about â€˜flagâ€™.Just then,I discovered the poet in me( if we can call it a poem).The poem (I would rather refer to it as â€˜linesâ€™)   describes the â€˜flag manâ€™.If you are true folk of Kathmandu,you might have understood that I am talking about Laxmi Narayan Shilpakar(hope I got his name correct).He is always seen holding the national flag.Thanks to him,wherever we are:whether stuck in traffic,in rain or under the clear blue sky,he gives us the insight of who we are!</p>

<p>To me,our flag is a symbol of national solidarity and it is an awakening moment everytime I see it flutter.But today I felt different because I saw flags.Flags of different colours:the red and blue national flags,red flags,white flags,yellow flags,orange flags,green flags,blue flags and flags of many other colours;flags of different kinds:the triangular flags,rectangular flags with sun,moon,stars,pen,hammers printed on them.Today I didnâ€™t see the flag man.Instead found out that thousands of people of different kinds walked into the street with flags.They were short,tall,men,women,young,old but no â€˜flag manâ€™.I know what our flag means to me but didnâ€™t understand the meaning of those different kinds of colourful walking flags.</p>

<p>â€˜Flagâ€™ has changed itâ€™s meaning.The flags people held in their hands today was â€˜their flagâ€™,not â€˜ourâ€™.Their flag is merely a piece of cloth,its sold in the market,it walks wherever  people walk and speaks only in revolts.â€™Ourâ€™ flag is the one â€˜flag manâ€™holds,one that awakens people everytime it flutters,one that lives within us.</p>
