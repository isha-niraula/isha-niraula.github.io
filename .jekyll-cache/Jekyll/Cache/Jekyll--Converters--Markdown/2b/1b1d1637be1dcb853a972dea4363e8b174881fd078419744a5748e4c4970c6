I"¨<p>It was about 8:30 in the morning when the bus on which i had boarded to reach college,stopped at Jamal.I looked out of the window to see what had happened.All the vehicles had stopped.Nothing was moving except for a huge mass of people who were heading towards â€˜Jame Masjidâ€™(the biggest mosque in Kathmandu).I had almost forgotten that it was a public holiday.It was the last day of month of Ramadan,Eid ul-fitr.</p>
